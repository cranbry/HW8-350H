# HW8-350H
Unity 3D project using a script that allows a GameObject to automatically grow and shrink over time, while including logic to reverse the growth direction. Aiming to deepen understanding of Unity's update loop, GameObject manipulation, and a Timer concept.

# How it works?
 - Using Unity's Update loop to continuously change the GameObject's localeScale property.
 - Impleted timer using Time.deltaTime to track when direction changes should happen.
 - Controlled scaling direction using sign change that flips between positive and negative values.
 - Incrementing scale change for smooth transition.
